Design Document Revisions:

Message Formats
	Upon further review, we have decided to go with a packet consisting of:
	data/ack flag, a 10-bit sequence number, a 4-bit thread ID, an 8-bit epoch, an 8-bit length field, 252B of data, and an 8-bit CRC-8 checksum of this data. 

Window Data Structure
	This has remained the same as outlined in our Design Document.  Send and Receive Windows coordinate the reliability.
	
Window Operations
	This remains unchanged as well.
	
Thread Assignments
	We left the thread assignments the same as we had originally intended in the Design Document.
	
Head-of-Line Blocking
	We intended to have threads time out in order to prevent head of line blocking.  This is still the case in our implementation.

Fairness
	We have let our implementation of the problem handle fairness.  Threads should be prevented from blocking other threads.
	This is accomplished through our timeouts and implementation.
	
Channel Release
	We kept our channel release implementation the same as we had outlined in the Design Document.  When a channel is no longer needed, the lock is released.
